# Color Marketplace

## Description

Color Marketplace is a decentralized NFT marketplace built on the Story Layer 2 network. It's designed to integrate seamlessly with the Story Protocol, providing a platform for trading IP assets while respecting and enforcing the protocol's licensing and royalty mechanisms.

This is a completely on-chain solution, however we may plan to go partially off-chain in the future. ðŸ˜Š

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html)

### Deployment

1. Edit the deployment script at `script/ColorMarketplace.s.sol` to set your parameters.

2. Copy the example environment file and fill in your variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Deploy to Sepolia testnet:
   ```bash
   forge script ColorMarketPlaceDeploy --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --verify --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY --broadcast
   ```

### Usage

#### Listing and buying life cycle

- User A creates a listing:

```
A calls createListing(ListingParameters{
    assetContract: NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    tokenId: 1,
    startTime: CURRENT_TIME,
    secondsUntilEndTime: 7 DAYS,
    currency: ERC20_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
    buyoutPrice: 1 ETHER,
    royaltyInfo: RoyaltyInfo{receiver: ROYALTY_RECEIVER, percentage: 250} // 2.5%
  })
```

- User B buys the listing:

```
B calls buy(listingId: 0, buyFor: B's_ADDRESS)
```

#### Bidding on listings

- User C makes an offer:

```
  C calls offer(listingId: 0, price: 0.8 ETHER, expirationTimestamp: CURRENT_TIME + 1 DAY)
```

- User A (listing owner) accepts the offer:

```
  A calls acceptOffer(listingId: 0, offeror: C's_ADDRESS)
```

#### Admin commands

- Update platform fee:

```
  Admin calls setPlatformFeeInfo(newFeeRecipient: FEE_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS, newFeeBps: 250) // 2.5%
```

- Add ERC20 token to whitelist:

```
  Admin calls erc20WhiteListAdd(tokenAddress: NEW_ERC20_TOKEN_ADDRESS)
```

- Remove ERC20 token from whitelist:

```
Admin calls erc20WhiteListRemove(tokenAddress: ERC20_TOKEN_ADDRESS)
```

- Transfer admin ownership:

```
Admin calls transferAdminOwnership(newAdmin: NEW_ADMIN_ADDRESS)
```

- Cancel a listing:

```
Admin calls adminCancelListing(listingId: LISTING_ID)
```

- Cancel an offer:

```
Admin calls adminCancelOffer(listingId: LISTING_ID, offeror: OFFEROR_ADDRESS)
```

#### How royalties work

Royalties are set when creating a listing and cannot be changed after listing creation. They are specified as a percentage (in basis points) and a receiver address.

- When a sale occurs, the royalty is calculated as:

```
royaltyAmount = salePrice * royaltyPercentage / 10000
```

- The royalty is sent to the specified receiver address during the sale transaction.
- Royalties are optional. If no royalty is desired, set the receiver to the zero address and percentage to 0.

## Testing

To run the test suite:

```bash
forge test
```

For more detailed output, including traces for failing tests, use:

```bash
forge test -vvvv
```

Optionally mark the test you want to focus on with:

```bash
forge test --match-test  testFunctionName
```

And for gas reports:

```bash
forge test --gas-report
```

## Security

While we strive to ensure the security of our smart contracts, please note:

1. This project is currently unaudited. We plan to conduct a professional audit in the near future. These will be made available in this repo.

2. The contract uses OpenZeppelin's security features including ReentrancyGuard and AccessControl.

3. This is experimental software and users interact with it at their own risk.

We advise users to exercise caution and not to commit funds they cannot afford to lose.

## Contributing

We are still in the early version of this marketplace, and are likely to move to an off-chain solution that follow closer to modern marketplace structures. So this project may become stale quickly. Contribute at your own time risk!

## Todo:

- Add minimum offer amounts on listings. Or a number to deny the ability to offer?
