# Color Marketplace

## Description

Color Marketplace is a decentralized NFT marketplace built on the Story Layer 2 network. It's designed to integrate seamlessly with the Story Protocol, providing a platform for trading IP assets while respecting and enforcing the protocol's licensing and royalty mechanisms.

This is a completely on-chain solution, however we may plan to go partially off-chain in the future. ðŸ˜Š

## Security

While we strive to ensure the security of our smart contracts, please note:

1. This project is currently unaudited. We plan to conduct a professional audit in the near future. These will be made available in this repo.

2. The contract uses OpenZeppelin's security features including ReentrancyGuard and AccessControl.

3. This is experimental software and users interact with it at their own risk.

We advise users to exercise caution and not to commit funds they cannot afford to lose.

## Contributing

We are still in the early version of this marketplace, and are likely to move to an off-chain solution that follow closer to modern marketplace structures. So this project may become stale quickly. Contribute at your own time risk!

## Todo:

- Upgradability patterns (could redeploy and switch front end to point to new address, while supporting last one still.)
- Royalties for the Story protocol
- Add minimum offer amounts on listings. Or a number to deny the ability to offer?
